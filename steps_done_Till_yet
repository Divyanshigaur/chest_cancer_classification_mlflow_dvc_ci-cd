You can confidently say:

✔ Git initialized

✔ DVC initialized

✔ Dataset tracked with DVC (not Git)

✔ Clean commit history

“I initialized Git and DVC, ensured large datasets are tracked using DVC instead of Git, and verified data integrity using DVC status.”

 Phase 2: Model Training + MLflow
 wrote code in train.py
 “The training script loads parameters from params.yaml, trains a CNN on chest cancer images, logs experiments using MLflow, and saves the trained model. The script is executed via a DVC pipeline for reproducibility.”

Big picture (one line)

DVC manages data & ML pipelines.
CI/CD automates running those pipelines and deploying results

1️⃣ Activate correct environment BEFORE running code

In VS Code terminal (or PowerShell):
conda activate chest_ml

4️⃣ What files will be created after training(train.py)
After training finishes, you should see:

📁 models/
Saved model file (e.g. .h5, .pt, .keras)

📁 mlruns/
MLflow experiment logs

Metrics (accuracy, loss)

Parameters (epochs, batch size, lr)

📄 mlflow.db
MLflow tracking database

This proves:

“I trained a model with experiment tracking (MLOps)”
